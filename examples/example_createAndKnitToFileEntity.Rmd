Name:
  createAndKnitToFileEntity

Usage:
  createAndKnitToFileEntity(markdownfile, parentId='syn123', fileName = NULL, wikiName = NULL, overwrite = FALSE, knitmd = TRUE, ...)

    markdownfile: a path to a markdown file (including RMarkdown files)
    parentId: The Entity where the Rmd should be stored (this can be a Project, or Folder entity id)
    fileName: Synapse entity name of the file. If NULL then the markdownfile name will be used by default
    wikiName: optionally you can provide names for your wiki pages/sub-pages
    overwrite: If true, deletes all the previous versions of the exisitng wiki and overwrites it with new wiki (use it with caution)
    knitmd: If false, will not knit the markdown, instead will get the markdown from local cache
    ...: Optional paramters to synapser::synStore, like used, executed, activity, activityName, activityDescription, etc...

Overview:
  This function knits your Rmd to md file and pushes the Rmd to synapse as new file, and populates the wiki markdowns and plots as file attachments

Working example:
## Example chunk to run for kniting the markdown
```{r create.file.in.synapse, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Note the eval=FALSE tag in the chiunk options, if true then the kniting process will be in infinite loop

library(synapser) # Load synapser package and login in to synapse before using knit2synapse
library(knit2synapse) # Get the package from devtools::install_github('Sage-Bionetworks/knit2synapse')

synLogin() # Login in to synapse before running knit2synapse

knit2synapse::createAndKnitToFileEntity(file = "./example_createAndKnitToFolderEntity.Rmd", # This markdown file name
                                        parentId = "syn117", # parentId to store this file in synapse
                                        fileName = "Example for createFile") # optional fileName
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
  
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
  
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
