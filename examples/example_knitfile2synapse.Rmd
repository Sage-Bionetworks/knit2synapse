Name:
  knitfile2synapse

Usage:
knitfile2synapse(markdownfile, owner='syn123', parentWikiId = NULL, wikiName = NULL, overwrite = FALSE)

    markdownfile: a path to a markdown file (including RMarkdown files)
    owner: The Entity where the Wiki page should go (this can be a Project, File, or Folder entity id)
    parentWikiId: If supplied, will make a sub-Wiki underneath this Wiki ID. Note that this is not a Synapse ID (does not start with syn, it is an integer)
    wikiName: optionally you can provide names for your wiki pages/sub-pages
    overwrite: If true, deletes all the previous versions of the exisitng wiki and overwrites it with new wiki (use it with caution)

Overview:
  This function knits your Rmd to md file and pushes the md and all the relevant plots in the md as synapse wiki markdowns and file attachments to synapse

Working example:
## Example chunk to run for knitting the markdoen 
```{r knit.file.2.synapse, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Note the eval=FALSE tag in the chiunk options, if true then the kniting process will be in infinite loop

library(synapser) # Load synapser package and login in to synapse before using knit2synapse
library(knit2synapse) # Get the package from devtools::install_github('Sage-Bionetworks/knit2synapse')

synLogin() # Login in to synapse before running knit2synapse

knit2synapse::knitfile2synapse(file = "./example_knitfile2synapse.Rmd", # This file name
                               owner = "syn455", # wikiId of an exisitng synapse entity. Note for this function to work the synapse entity should already exists. For creating and populating wikis use one of the wrapper functions (createAndKnitToFileEntity or createAndKnitToFolderEntity)
                               wikiName = "Example for knit2synapse") # optional wikiname
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
